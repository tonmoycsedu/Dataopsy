Try out the demo here using the Adult income dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult) here: http://dataopsy.herokuapp.com/book/adult_full/index/count

The project is written in vanilla JS with a Flask server on the backend. We will convert the project to React framework soon. Stay tuned!
For now, to get started,

1. Install the packages in requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Go to the project folder and from CMD/terminal type: python app.py
   This should start the server at http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/book/adult_full/index/count to try out Dataopsy on the Adult income dataset.
